# You should be able to:

- DFA: Deterministic Finite Automata
- NFA: Nondeterministic Fintite Automata
- $\varepsilon$NFA: 

## Regular Expressions

- Write a regular expression (regexp).
- Know how to convert a regexp into an $\varepsilon$NFA.
- $\varepsilon$NFA into an NFA.
- NFA into a DFA.
- Know Kleene's Theorem and apply it to show that languages are regular.
- Know how to test whether DFAs are language equivalent.
- Know how to minimise a DFA.
- How to prove that a DFA is minimal.

_You don't need to know how to convert a DFA into a regexp._
