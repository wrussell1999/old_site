# Regular Expressions

**Definition:** A sequence of symbols, characters, and numbers expressing a string or pattern to be searched for within a chunck of text.

## Languages

An alphabet may be represented with $\Sigma$.

A language is a subset $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$, also known as a set of words.

A language is regular if it can be represented by a regular expression.

The set of regular expressions is countable. However, the set of languages is uncountable

_Countable:_

## Kleene's Theorem

### Theorem 1

For a language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$:

1. $L$ is regular _(can be described by a regular expression.)_
2. THe matching problem for $L$ can be solved by a DFA.

### Definition

Any regular language is accepted by a finite automaton and conversely that any language accepted by an finite automaton is regular.

### Proof
