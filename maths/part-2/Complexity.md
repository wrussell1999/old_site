# Complexity

The complexity of a problem depends on the particular machine we're using.

Some problems can be solved efficiently on on kind of model, but not on another.

## Steps

The duration of a step is a fixed length of time.

Always think in terms of steps rather than seconds.

## Big O Notation

$f(n) \le C \cdot g(n)$ for $n \ge M$

$C$ is a constant

_$C'$ and $C''$ are just other constants. It's another way of saying $C_0, C_1, C_2$_

We don't care about the cases when $n < M$, only $n \ge M$.

### Proofs

#### Running time proofs
1. Set the function to $\leq C$
2. Divide the function by the $n$ expressed as Big O
3. Simplify and set a value of $n$
4. Using a value of $n$, calculate a value for $C$
5. Show these steps backwards to prove it
