# Set Theory

## Set

A collection of elements/members.

A member is only counted once.

∈ means element of, or epsilon.

We would write it like:

_x_ ∈ _A_

_where x is an element, and A represents Set A_.

This shows that element _x_ is part of Set _A_


## Cardinality
The size of a set.

## Countable

A countable set is a set with the same cardinality as some subset of the set of natural numbers. 

It is a countably infinite set, if it has the same cardinality as the natural numbers.
