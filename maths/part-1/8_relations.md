# Relations

## Reflexivity

## Symmetry

## Transitivity

Think of it as jumping to the finish line, and skipping the bits that connect the start and finish together.

_A_ ⊆ _B_ and _B_ ⊆ _C_. So surely, _A_ ⊆ _C_?

How do we prove this....?

Proof:
Suppose _A_ ⊆ _B_ and _B_ ⊆ _C_,

Also, suppose _x_ ∈ _A_, Then _x_ ∈ _B_, because _A_ ⊆ _B_.

Since _x_ ∈ _B_ and _B_ ⊆ _C_, therefore _x_ ∈ _C_.


## Theorem

If ≈ is an equivalence relation on a set _A_, and _a_,_b_ are elements of _A_, then always one of the
following two situations is true; either _a_ ≈ _b_ and [_a_]≈ = [_b_]≈, or _a_ !≈ _b_ and [_a_]≈ ∩[_b_]≈ = /0.
